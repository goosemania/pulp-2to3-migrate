# later. And it is nice to have a friendly identifier for it.
# So we use the branch preferably, but need to replace the "/" with the valid
# character "_" .

# Note that there are lots of other valid git branch name special characters
# that are invalid in image tag names. To try to convert them, this would be a
# starting point:
